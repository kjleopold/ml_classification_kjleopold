# Peer Review: Branton - Midterm Project: Classification Analysis

**Notebook Link:** [Branton - Midterm Project Notebook](https://github.com/bjdawson23/ml_classification_branton/blob/main/notebooks/ml_classification_branton/ml_classification_branton.ipynb)

## 1. Clarity & Organization
The notebook is really easy to follow and is organized well. The comments and plots make it clear what’s going on.  

**Ideas for improvement:** I thought the project was very professional and followed the outline we have been taught. I honestly don't have any ideas on how to improve upon anything in this area. 

## 2. Feature Selection & Justification
The features you picked—age_group, chol_level, and thalach—make sense for predicting heart disease. I like that you binned age and cholesterol; it makes the models easier to work with.  

**Ideas for improvement:** It might be cool to try combining multiple features into one model since one feature at a time can only tell part of the story. A quick plot showing how the features relate to the target could help too.

## 3. Model Performance & Comparisons
I like that you compared Decision Tree and SVM, and that you showed accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The bar chart makes it easy to see which model did better.  

**Ideas for improvement:** Maybe try cross-validation to get more reliable results. Some confusion matrix plots would make it easier to see where the models are messing up. Also, a sentence about why cholesterol didn’t work as well would be helpful.

## 4. Reflection Quality
Your reflections show that you thought about the results and connected them to heart disease risk. You also talked about limitations and next steps.  

**Ideas for improvement:** You could mention possible biases in the dataset, like age or sex distribution. Also, a short note on how combining features could improve predictions would make the reflection even stronger.
